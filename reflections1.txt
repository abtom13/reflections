1. How did viewing the difference between two files help wth spotting bugs?

Visually spotting the differences showed changes that might have introduced bugs by regression.

2. As a programmer when do you want to save files in progress?

Only when I want it to be saved rather than periodically. Saving periodically can be painful because intermediate versions 
might even be non-compilable and therefore not worth retaining. I might want to save only when it is logically at a saveable 
point - say when it is copiled and unnit tested.
